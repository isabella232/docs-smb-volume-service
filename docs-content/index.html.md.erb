## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Shared Volumes are distributed file systems that allow instances of an application to share the same mounted volume and access it concurrently.

The Shared Volume Service for SMB enables SMB driver support, so Azure file service and SMB shared folders can be used by the Shared Volume Service.

The SMB Volume Service Broker for PCF exposes the SMB service in the Marketplace. 
It installs SMB driver in every Diego cell, provides credentials, and the SMB share URL for Cloud Controller to mount 
SMB shares in a Diego cell. An application can bind to the service to use persistent SMB storage, such as Azure files.
